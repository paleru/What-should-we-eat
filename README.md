Fullstack web-application using MERN-stack, Vite and styled components.

Work in progress.

NOTE: The application is currently hosted on render's free tier. It will be paused in the case of prolonged inactivity, meaning it will usually take up to a minute to get it started when visiting the link (in addition to slow load times).

TODO:
- [ ] Adding images only works when running on localhost. Fix.
- [ ] Let user edit recipe steps
- [ ] Let user upload image when adding recipe
- [X] File size restrictions when editing recipe image
- [X] Pressing 'enter' while adding steps or ingredients when adding/editing recipe should not submit full recipe.
- [ ] Get redirect when adding/editing recipe working again.
- [X] Steps/ingredients should not be allowed to be empty when adding recipes
- [ ] Undo capitalizing units
- [ ] Ingredients should not require both amount and unit
- [X] 'What to cook?' page based on available ingredients (implemented in 'find recipe' instead')
- [ ] Fix 'newest' showing oldest first when searching recipes and vice versa
